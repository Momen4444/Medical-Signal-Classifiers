# Medical-Signal-Classifiers
This repository contains code for the classification of medical signals using machine learning techniques. The signals include ECG and EEG data.
### ECG
1. contains arrhythmia classification using CNNs trained on -> [PTB-XL, a large publicly available electrocardiography dataset](https://physionet.org/content/ptb-xl/1.0.3/)

### EEG
1. contains alzheimer classification  using a random reinforcement tree trained on -> [A dataset of EEG recordings from: Alzheimer's disease, Frontotemporal dementia and Healthy subjects](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004504/versions/1.0.8)

2. contains motor imagery classification using CNNs trained on -> [EEG Motor Movement/Imagery Dataset](https://physionet.org/content/eegmmidb/1.0.0/)


3. contains seizure classification using CNNs trained on -> [CHB-MIT Scalp EEG Database](https://physionet.org/content/chbmit/1.0.0/)

4. Contains Parkinson's classification using CNNs, trained on -> [UC San Diego Resting State EEG Data from Patients with Parkinson's Disease]((https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds002778/versions/1.0.4)
